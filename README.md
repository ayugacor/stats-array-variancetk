## Overview

This repository contains a simple and efficient implementation of a one-pass algorithm to calculate the variance of an array. The variance is a key statistical measure that quantifies the dispersion of a set of data points. Understanding variance is crucial for data analysis, as it provides insight into how spread out the data is.

### Key Features

- **One-Pass Calculation**: This algorithm computes variance in a single pass through the data, making it efficient in terms of time complexity.
- **Unbiased Estimation**: The implementation provides an unbiased estimate of the sample variance, ensuring accurate results.
- **JavaScript Implementation**: The code is written in JavaScript, making it easy to integrate into web applications or Node.js environments.

## Topics Covered

- Array manipulation
- Deviation and dispersion
- JavaScript and Node.js programming
- Mathematical concepts related to statistics
- Sample variance and standard deviation calculations

## Installation

To get started with the project, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ayugacor/stats-array-variancetk.git
cd stats-array-variancetk
```

Install the necessary dependencies if you are using Node.js:

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

To calculate the variance of an array, use the following function:

```javascript
const { calculateVariance } = require('./variance');

const data = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];
const variance = calculateVariance(data);
console.log(`Variance: ${variance}`);
```

This will output the variance of the provided array. Make sure to replace `data` with your own array of numbers.

## Example

Here is a complete example of how to use the variance calculation function:

```javascript
const { calculateVariance } = require('./variance');

const sampleData = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25];
const result = calculateVariance(sampleData);

console.log(`The variance of the sample data is: ${result}`);
```

### Variance Calculation

The variance is calculated using the formula:

\[
Var(X) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (X_i - \bar{X})^2
\]

Where:
- \( Var(X) \) is the variance
- \( n \) is the number of observations
- \( X_i \) are the individual data points
- \( \bar{X} \) is the mean of the data points

This implementation efficiently computes the mean and variance in a single traversal of the array, minimizing the time complexity.

## API Reference

### `calculateVariance(data)`

- **Parameters**: 
  - `data` (Array): An array of numbers for which the variance is to be calculated.
- **Returns**: 
  - `number`: The calculated variance of the input array.

### Example Usage

```javascript
const variance = calculateVariance([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]);
console.log(variance); // Output: 2.5
```

## Performance

The algorithm runs in O(n) time complexity, making it suitable for large datasets. The one-pass nature ensures that you only loop through the data once, thus optimizing performance.

## Testing

To ensure the reliability of the implementation, run the provided test suite. You can execute the tests using:

```bash
npm test
```

The test suite covers various scenarios, including edge cases and large datasets.
